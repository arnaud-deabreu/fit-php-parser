## 👋🏻 Introduction
Welcome to the FIT File Parser Library, a PHP-based library designed to parse FIT files. FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) files are commonly used in fitness devices to store workout data. This library is inspired by the Garmin SDK but is developed independently with the goal of providing an open-source alternative for the PHP community.  
The FIT protocol documentation can be found [here](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/)

> Garmin is a registered trademark of Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries, and this library is an independent project that is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Garmin in any way.

## 🛠️ Features
FIT File Parsing: Read and parse FIT files into PHP data objects.

## 📚 Installation
To use the library, install it with this command:

```bash
composer require arnaud-deabreu/fit-php-parser
```

## 📝 Parse a FIT file

```php
<?php

use FitParser\Parser;

$parser = new Parser(
    file_get_contents('path/to/fit/file.fit')
);
$parser->parse();

$parser->getRecords(); // FitParser\Records\Record[]
```

## 🧙🏻‍♂️ Generated Messages and Fields classes
To generate the necessary Messages and Fields classes for decoding binary strings from FIT files, you need to use the `make fitparser-gen-profile` command.  
This command requires the `Profile.xlsx` file, which is provided in the Garmin SDK.  
First, download the Garmin SDK from Garmin's Developer Website. Once downloaded, locate the Profile.xlsx file within the SDK and place it in the data folder of this project.  
After positioning the file correctly, you can run the `make fitparser-gen-profile command`, which will process the file and generate the classes needed for parsing and decoding FIT file data.
